You sit on the edge of the river bank, feeling very tired of having nothing to do. The book your sister is reading is very
boring, since there are no pictures or conversations in it at all. Just then, you see a WHITE RABBIT run past.

"I'm late, I'm late!" says the rabbit - and it runs away to the NORTH
>> look

You are sitting on the edge of the river bank, your sister has fallen asleep with the book in her lap. The WHITE RABBIT ran
NORTH.
>> talk sister

 "ZZZZZ" snores your sister
>> north

Following the rabbit, it's trail leads you on a twisting path for some time. Eventually, you find yourself before a rabbit
hole, that leads DOWN into pitch blackness
>> down

You take a few tentative steps into the rabbit hole before you lose your footing and fall. You seem to fall forever, with
strange, hypnotic patterns surrounding you on all sides. Peculiar visions of KEYS, the RABBIT, and a horrible QUEEN pass
before your eyes before fading back into the mess of colours all around you. You fall for so long, you begin to wonder if
you should soon pass straight through the Earth itself. Just as you begin to resign yourself to this fate, you feel your
feet gently touch the ground.

You find yourself in a large room with vaulted celings. Looking up, you notice the ceiling is perfectly smooth, with no sign
of the hole you just fell through. There is one HUGE door to the NORTH and a GOLDEN door to the EAST. Nearby there is a table
with two boxes on it. One says EAT ME, containing a small cake, and the other says DRINK ME, containing a small vial.

Arrayed around where you are standing, you see four slots in the ground that appear to be keyholes. Surely, if you find the
keys and DROP them here, this room will open a way for you to escape wonderland...

>> go north

Opening the huge door, you find yourself on a pleasant country road, with a warm and sunny forest surrounding you. The air
smells sweet and clean, and you can hear the sound of bees buzzing and birds chirping. Just as the door opens, you catch
a brief view of the WHITE RABBIT, who jumps in surprise and runs away to the NORTH when he sees you.
>> look

You are on the pleasant forest path, the path leads further into the forest to the NORTH, and the HUGE DOOR is open to the
SOUTH. Now that you are taking some time to look around, you see something shiny just off the trail. It's a pile of beautiful
JEWELS!

Following the WHITE RABBIT down the forest path, you soon find yourself outside a small cottage. The rabbit is sitting in
the front yard, anxiously peering down the path. Now that you are closer to the rabbit, you see that he has a keyring on
his belt, with a small GOLDEN KEY, as well as a SPADE KEY. The path continues past the house to the EAST
>> talk rabbit

"Hello little girl. Didn't I see you at the top of the hole? No matter, have you seen my FAN? I seem to have misplaced it,
and it's terribly important to me."
>> talk rabbit

"If you should find my FAN, please bring it to me, and I shall reward you handsomely!"
>> talk rabbit

"Please bring my FAN to me."
>> go east

You find yourself in a small meadow with a long, crowded table in the center of it. Around the table are many chairs of various
makes and sizes. Sitting at the head of the table you see a man with crazy tufts of hair stuffed below a ragged old hat.
Beside the man, you see a hare. They are enjoying a cup of tea together, and don't seem to have noticed you at all.

There are paths leading out of the clearing to the NORTH and SOUTH.
>> talk to the mad hatter

"Welcome welcome, please have something to drink! What's that? You haven't had anything? Well it's much easier to have more
of something than nothing!" The Hatter gestures to the table full of goodies.
>> talk hatter

The HATTER checks his watch "Why YES! It is in fact Tuesday! Very astute of you."
>> talk hatter

"Now if you don't mind, I have a few riddles for you. If you answer well, there'll even be prizes!" says the HATTER. "Shall
we begin?" (Y/N)
>> yes

"Excellent! Now then, let me think of a good one..." and the hatter strokes his chin, contemplating.
"What goes up but never comes down?"
>> my age

"Yes! That's exactly right!" the hatter jumps up and down in his seat excitedly."
"I can fly, but have no wings. I can cry but have no eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"
>> a cloud

"Yes! That's exactly right!" the hatter jumps up and down in his seat excitedly."
"What has to be broken before you can use it?"
>> egg

"Yes! That's exactly right!" the hatter jumps up and down in his seat excitedly."

"Splendid showing! You are quite the riddler - positively RIDDLED in fact! Here are your prizes as promised."

The HATTER looks around the table absent-mindedly before something seems to catch his eye. He pulls an ornate key with a
head shaped like a playing-card's CLUB out of a nearby pot of jam "Here you are! Oh and you look like someone who could use
the time, as well." He pulls his watch from his coat pocket and hands it over with the sticky key.

out of the clearing to the NORTH, SOUTH, and WEST.
>> north

After travelling for some time, you find yourself on the edge of a vast sea. Near the coast, you see a house with smoke drifting
lazily from it's chimney. You approach the house, which lies to the NORTH, and quickly realize that it is much closer to
you than you thought - it is just that it is merely four feet tall! Much too small to enter...
>> drink potion

You drink a bit of the DRINK ME potion and become tiny.
>> go north

You enter the tiny house, and find a scene of domestic chaos laid out before you. A short elderly woman sits near the fireplace
knitting. She looks very regal, and you can see that she carries herself with an hauty air. Nearby where she is sitting is
a BIG BABY, nearly as large as the short woman herself. He is playing with an ornate DIAMOND KEY, using it as a rattle. Over
the fire is a comically large soup pot, filled with steaming liquid, and the overwhelming scent of pepper fills the air.
As you take in the scene, the old woman notices you, and beckons you over - "Come here, girl. Come let the DUCHESS see you."
The door out is to the SOUTH
>> use watch

Looking at the HATTER's strange watch you see that it is 2024-04-30T19:08:30.267849-06:00[America/Edmonton]
A very strange watch indeed...
>> talk to the duchess

"Hello little girl, would you like some soup? It has just enough pepper for my liking, but my boy here seems to think there's
too much. He just can't stop sneezing when I stir it."
>> talk duchess

"Have you tried the soup? It's just as spicy as I like it, with all that pepper!"
>> talk duchess

"You seem like such a nice girl. I have a very good nose for these things, you know. I am always right about it. Yes, you
are clearly one of the good ones! Why,  I'm so sure of it I'll give you a LETTER of recommendation." The DUCHESS rummages
in her apron pocket for a moment before producing a beautifully sealed letter. "I'd say that could get you out of a SPOT
OF TROUBLE, yes indeed. Well, thank you for visiting"

You are carrying:
EATME DRINKME JEWEL CLUBKEY WATCH LETTER
>> look

You are inside the tiny house of the DUCHESS. The BIG BABY is here with the DUCHESS and yourself. There is a massive pot
of soup over the fireplace, and the small, stuffy room smells overwhelmingly of pepper. The door outside is to the SOUTH.
>> stir soup

You grasp the massive ladle, and stir the large pot of soup as soon as the liquid begins to move, the air fills with the
scent of pepper, as a cloud of the spice is raised from the surface of the mixture. The BABY begins to sneeze uncontrollably,
and the DUCHESS begins to complain and beat the poor child. During the entire commotion, the DIAMOND KEY the child was playing
with somehow flies through the air and lands in your pocket. What luck!

You are outside the tiny house on the shore. Looking at it, you can see signs of life inside - there is movement in the windows
and smoke is coming from the tiny chimney. There are paths leading EAST, and SOUTH. Now that you are looking more closely,
you see a FAN sitting in the bushes near the front door.

You are in an oppressively dark forest. After walking for a short time, you become hopelessly lost. All the trees around
you look the same, giving no clue to the direction out of the forest. After wandering for some time, you find yourself stopping
before a particularly gnarled tree. The path goes off in ALL DIRECTIONS here, and peering into the tree, you see that there
is a hole you could crawl into, leading DOWN into darkness within the tree.

It seems hopeless, what are you going to do?

You feel hot tears begin to roll down your face in frustration, but through your blurred vision you see a grinning set of
teeth materialize at the top of the tree, followed shortly after by the rest of a CHESHIRE CAT.

"What is the matter, little girl? Are you lost? Have you tried being found?"
>> talk cheshire

"Hello little girl, are you lost? It simply doesn't do to be lost - I would try being found instead."
>> talk cat

"This forest is not an easy place to get out of. If you know what's UP, or what's DOWN you can at least always get out. But
to go forwards requires a twisty and winding trail."
>> talk cat

"If you are certain you can make it through, you'd be RIGHT, but if you're not certain, you'll be LEFT behind, and LEFT behind
is not what you want, I suspect. That is, if I'm RIGHT, I'm sure you'll get STRAIGHT out of here."
>> south

You walk down the forest path, but quickly become hopelessly lost. Every tree looks the same, and you can't remember which
path you took to get here. You are at a crossroads, with paths leading STRAIGHT, LEFT, or RIGHT.
Which way do you go?
>> right

You go RIGHT. It feels like you're closer to the exit.

You have found your way out of the darkest parts of the DARK FOREST. You now feel that you can find your way through with
little difficulty.
You are at the rabbit's house. The WHITE RABBIT stands outside. The path you are on leads to the SOUTH and the EAST

You are on the pleasant forest path, the path leads further into the forest to the NORTH, and the HUGE DOOR is open to the
SOUTH. Now that you are taking some time to look around, you see something shiny just off the trail. It's a pile of beautiful

You feel a hand reach into your pocket! Before you can react, the THIEF has pulled the JEWEL out of your pocket. As soon
as he has it, he runs away.

The path beneath your feet goes from an unfinished dirt walking path to a pristinely cobbled trail nearly imperceptibly,
and you find yourself in a grand and lavish garden. To your left you see four playing cards busily painting white roses red,
and talking worriedly amongst themselves. Further ahead, you can see a large open area where a group of well-dressed people
are playing croquet. Everyone in the game seems to be deferring to one person in particular, and with a closer look you realize
that this imposing figure is in fact the QUEEN OF HEARTS herself. Nearby, lies an elegant CROQUET MALLET in the shape of
a flamingo.

As you inspect the mallet, you hear the QUEEN shreik: "OFF WITH THEIR HEAD!" and see one of the other players quickly apprehended
and dragged away from the game
>> take mallet

You picked up CROQUETMALLET
>> talk cards

"Oh hello, sorry but we don't have time to talk right now," says the seven. "Yes, we are quite too busy for you right now,"
agrees agrees the five. The two remains silent, focusing on the task of painting.
>> talk cards

"What do you mean, why are we painting these roses?"
>> talk cards

The five and the seven look worriedly at the two when you keep asking them questions. The two answers "You see, the QUEEN
OF HEARTS wants a garden full of beautiful red roses, but we accidentally planted white ones, and we are painting to fix
our mistake" the two of hearts glances back at the croquet game once more "please do not tell the QUEEN!"
>> talk cards

"Please don't tell the queen what we're up to!"
>> talk queen

"And WHAT do you WANT? I suppose you are here to beg for trinkets, baubles, and all sorts of inconsequential drivel. It's
all anyone EVER TALKS ABOUT!"
>> talk queen

"Out with it then! Or off with it it will be!"
>> talk queen

"THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH OUT OF YOU YOUNG LADY!"
>> talk queen

The QUEEN looks at you with disgust. "You have lingered far too long, young lady! This is most improper! You must know that
impropriety is punishable by DEATH! OFF WITH HER HEAD" the QUEEN's voice rises higher and higher as she speaks, reaching
screeching heights. She gestures to some nearby guards, and they begin to close in on you.

As it looks as though you are about to be grabbed, a small and portly fellow squeezes out from the crowd of onlookers. He
is wearing a crown adorned with hearts. This must be the KING "Now, my dear, we agreed that we shan't be beheading without
a trial from now on..." he says quietly. The QUEEN turns a few shades redder before the colour drains from her face a a little
and she visibly collects herself before presenting you with a saccharine smile. "Of course, my dear, you are quite right.
Then we shall have a TRIAL! How exciting! BRThe entire retinue looks quite excited, as they follow the KING and QUEEN down
a garden path. You feel hands on your arms, as some guards grab you and usher you down the same path behind the royal retinue.
You soon find yourself in a spacious paved squre in the garden's center, with the royal retinue arrayed about the fringes
of the square, eagerly awaiting the beginning of the trial. The KING and QUEEN sit at the far end of the square in large
thrones. BRA scribe comes forth and proclaims to the assembled crowd: "WE HAVE BEFORE US THE ACCUSED, ALICE, WHO SHALL STAND
TRIAL FOR THE CRIME OF SPEAKING ENTIRELY TOO LONG WITH HER ROYAL MAJESTY, THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. THIS IS A MOST EGREGIOUS CRIME
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY FOR THIS CRIMINAL?"


There is a terrible silence, and you swear you could hear a pin drop. Just as it seems hopeless, you see a familiar, albeit
very tiny figure step forth from the assembled crowd. It takes you a moment to recognize them, but you soon realize that
this is the DUCHESS coming to your aid. "Why yes," says the DUCHESS, "I can attest that this is a very nice young lady. She
came to my cabin recently and we had a very nice chat. As a matter of fact, I gave her a letter of recommendation." The QUEEN
looks very startled to hear this and asks: "Is this true, child? Check her pockets!"


The guards come up to you and rifle through your pockets, quickly finding the LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION from the DUCHESS.
Upon seeing it, the QUEEN looks very flustered. "Well then, I suppose you must be proper enough then, for the DUCHESS to
recommend you personally. Very well then, this court finds the defendant NOT GUILTY! As recompense for this false accusation,
please accept this small token." The QUEEN gestures and a servant runs forward with a beautiful pillow upon which rests a
HEART KEY.

"Now begone!" screams the QUEEN, and you are quickly brought back to the garden proper along with the rest of the royal retinue.

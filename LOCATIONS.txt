START {
  You sit on the edge of the river bank, feeling very tired of having nothing to do. The book your sister is reading is
  very boring, since there are no pictures or conversations in it at all. Just then, you see a WHITE RABBIT run past.
  BR "I'm late, I'm late!" says the rabbit - and it runs away to the NORTH;
  You are sitting on the edge of the river bank, your sister has fallen asleep with the book in her lap. The WHITE RABBIT ran

rabbithole {
  You take a few tentative steps into the rabbit hole before you lose your footing and fall. You seem to fall forever, with
  strange, hypnotic patterns surrounding you on all sides. Peculiar visions of KEYS, the RABBIT, and a horrible QUEEN pass
  before your eyes before fading back into the mess of colours all around you. You fall for so long, you begin to wonder if you
  should soon pass straight through the Earth itself. Just as you begin to resign yourself to this fate, you feel your feet
  gently touch the ground. BR You find yourself in a large room with vaulted celings. Looking up, you notice the ceiling is perfectly
  smooth, with no sign of the hole you just fell through. There is one HUGE door to the NORTH and a GOLDEN door to the EAST. Nearby
  there is a table with two boxes on it. One says EAT ME, containing a small cake, and the other says DRINK ME, containing a small vial.
  BR Arrayed around where you are standing, you see four slots in the ground that appear to be keyholes. Surely, if you find the keys
  and DROP them here, this room will open a way for you to escape wonderland...;

  Opening the huge door, you find yourself on a pleasant country road, with a warm and sunny forest surrounding you. The air
  smells sweet and clean, and you can hear the sound of bees buzzing and birds chirping. Just as the door opens, you catch a brief
  view of the WHITE RABBIT, who jumps in surprise and runs away to the NORTH when he sees you.;
  You are on the pleasant forest path, the path leads further into the forest to the NORTH, and the HUGE DOOR is open to the SOUTH.
  Now that you are taking some time to look around, you see something shiny just off the trail. It's a pile of beautiful JEWELS!;

  Following the WHITE RABBIT down the forest path, you soon find yourself outside a small cottage. The rabbit is sitting in the front
  yard, anxiously peering down the path. Now that you are closer to the rabbit, you see that he has a keyring on his belt, with a small
  GOLDEN KEY, as well as a SPADE KEY. The path continues past the house to the EAST;
  You are at the rabbit's house. The WHITE RABBIT stands outside. The path you are on leads to the SOUTH and the EAST;

  You find yourself in a small meadow with a long, crowded table in the center of it. Around the table are many chairs of various
  makes and sizes. Sitting at the head of the table you see a man with crazy tufts of hair stuffed below a ragged old hat. Beside the
  man, you see a hare. They are enjoying a cup of tea together, and don't seem to have noticed you at all. BR There are paths leading
  out of the clearing to the NORTH and SOUTH.;

  After travelling for some time, you find yourself on the edge of a vast sea. Near the coast, you see a house with smoke drifting
  lazily from it's chimney. You approach the house, which lies to the NORTH, and quickly realize that it is much closer to you than
  you thought - it is just that it is merely four feet tall! Much too small to enter...;
  You are outside the tiny house on the shore. Looking at it, you can see signs of life inside - there is movement in the windows and smoke
  is coming from the tiny chimney. There are paths leading EAST, and SOUTH. Now that you are looking more closely, you see a FAN sitting in
  the bushes near the front door.;

  You enter the tiny house, and find a scene of domestic chaos laid out before you. A short elderly woman sits near the fireplace
  knitting. She looks very regal, and you can see that she carries herself with an hauty air. Nearby where she is sitting is a BIG
  BABY, nearly as large as the short woman herself. He is playing with an ornate DIAMOND KEY, using it as a rattle. Over the fire is
  a comically large soup pot, filled with steaming liquid, and the overwhelming scent of pepper fills the air. As you take in the
  scene, the old woman notices you, and beckons you over - "Come here, girl. Come let the DUCHESS see you." The door out is to the
  SOUTH;
  You are inside the tiny house of the DUCHESS. The BIG BABY is here with the DUCHESS and yourself. There is a massive pot of soup over
  the fireplace, and the small, stuffy room smells overwhelmingly of pepper. The door outside is to the SOUTH.;

darkforest {
  You are in an oppressively dark forest. After walking for a short time, you become hopelessly lost. All the trees around you look the
  same, giving no clue to the direction out of the forest. After wandering for some time, you find yourself stopping before a
  particularly gnarled tree. The path goes off in ALL DIRECTIONS here, and peering into the tree, you see that there is a hole
  you could crawl into, leading DOWN into darkness within the tree. BR It seems hopeless, what are you going to do? BR You feel hot
  tears begin to roll down your face in frustration, but through your blurred vision you see a grinning set of teeth materialize
  at the top of the tree, followed shortly after by the rest of a CHESHIRE CAT. BR "What is the matter, little girl? Are you lost?
  Have you tried being found?";
  You are lost in the dark forest, there is no obvious way out. You stand before a gnarled tree, with paths leading off in ALL
  DIRECTIONS. Peering inside a hole in the tree you see the hole continues DOWN farther than you can see. What are you going to do?
  BR The CHESHIRE CAT sits above you in the tree, grinning at you. He looks like he has quite a bit to say...;

  The path beneath your feet goes from an unfinished dirt walking path to a pristinely cobbled trail nearly imperceptibly, and you find
  yourself in a grand and lavish garden. To your left you see four playing cards busily painting white roses red, and talking worriedly
  amongst themselves. Further ahead, you can see a large open area where a group of well-dressed people are playing croquet. Everyone
  in the game seems to be deferring to one person in particular, and with a closer look you realize that this imposing figure is in
  fact the QUEEN OF HEARTS herself. Nearby, lies an elegant CROQUET MALLET in the shape of a flamingo. BR As you inspect the mallet,
  you hear the QUEEN shreik: "OFF WITH THEIR HEAD!" and see one of the other players quickly apprehended and dragged away from the
  game;
  You are in the QUEEN OF HEARTS' garden. There is a game of croquet underway with the QUEEN herself playing.;
